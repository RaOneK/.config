  abstract = {In this paper we implement a simple strategy, based on Jin and Braza's method, to deal with nonreflecting outlet boundary conditions for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The outflow boundary conditions are implemented using an outflow zone downstream of the outlet, where particles are moved using an outgoing wave equation for the velocity field so that feedback noise from the outlet boundary is greatly reduced. For unidirectional flow across the outlet, this condition reduces to Orlanski's wave equation. The performance of the method is demonstrated through several two-dimensional test problems, including unsteady, plane Poiseuille flow, flow between two inclined plates, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a channel, and flow in a constricted conduit, and in three-dimensions for turbulent flow in a \$90\^\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ section of a curved square pipe. The results show that spurious waves incident from the outlet are effectively absorbed and that steady-state laminar flows can be maintained for much longer times compared to periodic boundary conditions. In addition, time-dependent anisotropies in the flow, like fluid recirculations, are convected across the outlet in a very stable and accurate manner.},

The method is applied to both structured and unstructured staggered mesh schemes. There are no splitting errors associated with the method; it satisfies the incompressibility condition to machine precision and reduces the number of unknowns. The exact projection technique is demonstrated on a two-dimensional cavity flow and a multiply connected moving domain with a free surface. Its performance is compared directly to classic fractional step methods and shown to be roughly twice as efficient. Boundary conditions and the relationship of the method to streamfunction-vorticity methods are discussed.}

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to adapt a nonreflecting outlet boundary condition, derived from a wave equation, to the numerical solution of the full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, for an elliptic unsteady free shear flow. The numerical results show that a significant improvement is achieved with this nonreflecting boundary condition, in comparison with the results obtained by using free boundary layer type conditions. The physical phenomena studied concern the onset of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the free (non-forced) shear layer and certain 2D characteristics of transition towards turbulence. These phenomena are simulated naturally, without imposing perturbations. The frequency of the organized vortices and the spread of the mixing layer are correctly predicted. The performances of the method are shown through comparison with the physical experiments. Owing to the nonreflecting boundary conditions, the feedback noises are inhibited effectively, so that the computation domain can be reduced and the dynamic characteristics of the flow are maintained up clearly to the outlet boundary.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate new boundary conditions for the incompressible, time-dependent Navier-Stokes equation. Especially inflow and outflow conditions are considered. The equations are linearized around a constant flow, so that we can use Laplace-Fourier technique to investigate the strength of boundary layers at open boundaries. Such layers are unphysical, and new boundary conditions are proposed so that these boundary layers are suppressed. We also show that the boundary conditions we propose do not produce divergence. Furthermore, they give solutions that do not grow in time, as long as the forcing function in the system does not. We also discuss the numerical treatment of boundaries when fourth-order accurate finite difference operators are used to approximate spatial derivatives. Using higher order methods introduces eigensolutions with boundary layer thickness of the same order of magnitude as the grid size. These eigensolutions have to be suppressed in order to not destroy the fourth-order accuracy of the method. Numerical results for the non-linear Navier-Stokes equation, together with the new boundary conditions, are presented. These calculations confirm that the results for the linearized problem hold for the non-linear problem as well.},

  abstract = {A finite volume method based on a velocity-only formulation is used to solve the flow field around a confined circular cylinder in a channel in order to investigate lateral wall proximity effects on stability, Strouhal number, hydrodynamic forces and wake structure behind the cylinder for a wide range of blockage ratios (0.1\&lt;{$\beta\leqslant$}0.9) and Reynolds numbers (0\&lt;Re{$\leqslant$}280). For blockage ratios less than approximately 0.85 a first critical Reynolds number is identified at which a supercritical Hopf bifurcation of the symmetric solution occurs. For blockage ratios greater than about 0.687 and at Reynolds numbers exceeding the first critical Reynolds number a second curve of neutral stability is seen, representing a pitchfork bifurcation of the steady symmetric solution to one of two possible steady asymmetric solutions. Either side of the neutral stability curve for the pitchfork bifurcation our linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations demonstrate that although the flow is linearly stable it is unstable to finite two-dimensional perturbations. At blockage ratios larger than about 0.82 the steady asymmetric solutions also become unstable through a Hopf bifurcation. In contrast with the first Hopf bifurcation of the symmetric solution at lower Reynolds numbers numerical calculations of the lift coefficient reveal that the oscillations are no longer symmetric in the rising and falling parts of each cycle. Very strong vortices shed from the cylinder and the wall cause drastic increases in the amplitudes of the lift and drag coefficients. A co-dimension 2 point where pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations occur simultaneously has been located in parameter space. Altogether, four distinct regions in the parameter space ({$\beta$},Re){$\in$}(0,0.9]{\texttimes}(0,280] have been identified, each corresponding to a different class of flow: (i) Steady symmetric flow, (ii) symmetric vortex shedding, (iii) steady asymmetric flow, and (iv) asymmetric vortex shedding, where a periodic-in-time flow is classed as symmetric or asymmetric depending on whether the time-average over one cycle of the lift coefficient is zero or not. Numerical solutions are computed on meshes having up to 1.8 million degrees of freedom. Extensive comparisons are made with the results available in the literature.},

  abstract = {While numerically solving a problem initially formulated on an unbounded domain, one typically truncates this domain, which necessitates setting the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) at the newly formed external boundary. The issue of setting the ABCs appears most significant in many areas of scientific computing, for example, in problems originating from acoustics, electrodynamics, solid mechanics, and fluid dynamics. In particular, in computational fluid dynamics (where external problems represent a wide class of important formulations) the proper treatment of external boundaries may have a profound impact on the overall quality and performance of numerical algorithms and interpretation of the results. Most of the currently used techniques for setting the ABCs can basically be classified into two groups. The methods from the first group (global ABCs) usually provide high accuracy and robustness of the numerical procedure but often appear to be fairly cumbersome and (computationally) expensive. The methods from the second group (local ABCs) are, as a rule, algorithmically simple, numerically cheap, and geometrically universal; however, they usually lack accuracy of computations. In this paper we first present an extensive survey and provide a comparative assessment of different existing methods for constructing the ABCs. Then, we describe a new ABCs technique proposed in our recent work and review the corresponding results. This new technique enables one to construct the ABCs that largely combine the advantages relevant to the two aforementioned classes of existing methods. Our approach is based on application of the difference potentials method by Ryaben'kii. This approach allows one to obtain highly accurate ABCs in the form of certain (nonlocal) boundary operator equations. The operators involved are analogous to the pseudodifferential boundary projections first introduced by Calderon and then also studied by Seeley. In spite of the nonlocality, the new boundary conditions are geometrically universal, numerically inexpensive, and easy to implement along with the existing solvers.},
